The girl walks on the column in foglight,
She ponders her past, thinking in hindsight,
Back in those moments, it all felt so right,
Even if she tried with all of her might,
She can never go back to all those nights,
When she did those things with such oversight,
Not realizing it was false delight,
Not grasping the future, only that night,
Remembering she was foolish outright,
She needs to free herself of all the fright,
To begin again, a torch to relight,
Dim fog rolls over, she senses a fight,
Her spiritual flower feuds the blight,
The end is the beginning, blurred insight.
